  "readme": "# express-debug\nexpress-debug is a development tool for [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express). It's simple middleware that\ninjects useful debugging output into your html, in a non-obstructive way.\n\nIt adds an 'EDT' tab to the right side of pages that, when clicked, displays info\nsuch as template variables (locals), current session, useful request data, and\ncurrent template.\n\nIf your application doesn't serve HTML, no worries, a standalone express-debug\npanel is mounted at `/express-debug`. See settings section for more information.\n\nexpress-debug should **NOT** be used in production environments.\n\n**Compatible with express 3.x and node 0.8+**\n\n\n**[Screenshot of the tool in action](http://i.imgur.com/rz3WgSp.png)**\n\n### Usage\n\n#### Install\n`npm install express-debug --save-dev`\n\n#### Use\n```js\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.configure('development', function() {\n    var edt = require('express-debug');\n    edt(app, {/* settings */});\n});\n\n/* ... application logic ... */\n```\n\n\n### Settings\n\n`depth` - How deep to recurse through printed objects.\n(Default: `4`)\n\n`theme` - Absolute path to a css file to include and override EDT's default css.\n\n`extra_panels` - additional panels to show. [See docs for custom panels](https://github.com/devoidfury/express-debug/blob/master/docs/custom_panels.md) and\n[included panels](https://github.com/devoidfury/express-debug/tree/master/lib/panels)\nfor proper structure, each panel is an object\n(Default: `[]`)\n\n`panels` - allows changing the default panels (ex: remove a panel)\n(Default: `['locals', 'request', 'session', 'template', 'software_info', 'profile']`)\n\n`path` - path to render standalone express-debug \\[set to `null` or `false` to disable\\]\n(Default: `/express-debug`)\n\n### Panels\n\n`locals` - app.locals, res.locals, and options passed to the template (merged into res.locals)\n\n`request` - req info. ip, body, query, files, route info, cookies, headers\n\n`session` - everything in req.session\n\n`template` - view name, template file\n\n`software_info` - shows current versions of node and libraries installed locally (not globally installed packages!)\n\n`profile` - total req processing time. middleware, param, and route timings.\n\n`other_requests` - shows details on non-page requests made to the server (not a default panel, use extra_panels setting to invoke. `{extra_panels: ['other_requests']}`)\n\n`nav` - links to every GET route in your app. (not a default panel)\n\n\n### Future\n* optional error page that prints better stacks\n* save more information about non-injected requests\n* improve styling\n* show session panel on standalone mount\n\n\n### Changelog\n* **1.0.3**\n  * usability fix: middleware order no longer matters, thanks to [connectr](https://github.com/olalonde/connectr)\n  * style tweaks\n\n* **1.0.2**\n  * add basic nav panel (not a default panel)\n  * style and usability improvements\n  * bugfixes\n\n\n* **1.0.1**\n  * sidebar moved to top and fixed position for better UX\n  * fix: render error no longer crashes application\n\n\n* **1.0.0** API changes\n  * no longer used as a regular middleware, invoke with `edt(app[, settings])` instead\n  * profile panel now acts like a regular panel\n  * add standalone express-debug page mounted at `path` setting\n  * add `standalone` panel setting\n  * add `pre-render` and `post-render` panel hooks\n  * profile panel now additionally profiles rendering\n\n\n* **0.2.4**\n  * no longer breaks error handling middleware\n\n\n* **0.2.3**\n  * add software info panel\n  * clean up\n\n\n* **0.2.2**\n  * finalize panel api\n\n\n* **0.2.1**\n  * add profiler panel\n  * modified style\n\n\n* **0.2.0**\n  * pluggable panels\n  * theme addition and bugfix by jaketrent\n\n\n* **0.1.2**\n  * objects can now be collapsed\n  * functions are now collapsed by default, showing only # of formal args and name, but can be expanded\n  * separated css and js from main toolbar template\n\n\n* **0.1.1**\n  * remove environment checks\n  * fix \"view engine\" directive, make template reading safer\n\n\n### License - MIT\nCopyright (c) 2013 Tom Hunkapiller and contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
